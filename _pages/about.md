I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the statistics department at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/). Previously, I studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Mississippi (Olemiss). During my time there, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Rizwanur Khan](http://home.olemiss.edu/~rrkhan/) and [Prof. Micah Milinovich](http://home.olemiss.edu/~mbmilino/) in number theory. 


Research Interest
======

I am broadly interested in the theory of machine learning. Some of my topics of interest include learning theory, online learning, adversarial robustness, vector-valued prediction, operator learning, and partial-feedback models. In the past, I have also dabbled in probabilistic models in number theory.
